DEFAULT LOGIN LOCATION
The login system seems designed to allow you to browse around without logging in, then remember were you were when you DO log in. This is fine for something like a blog, but not so good when you want to secure the system right at point of entry. I want to always take you to YOUR homepage upon login.
Considerations: 
	The login system has to take the location as a parameter, either config, or through a default attempt to always access http://server:port/contacts/index
	I don't need a welcome screen, the login screen will be all the welcome needed.
	Need to learn exactly how redirect_to and redirect_back_or_default work. Maybe have a url in the config which will always be redirected to.
	
	
DATES
Consistent display and convenient selection/formatting of dates.

USER ID - DONE!
Should be set automatically when creating a new contact. Some kind of hidden field on the view, pre-initialised with the user_id?
